## Description


&nbsp;This application is a single-page application (SPA) developed using HTML, SASS, JavaScript, and Webpack. Initially, I created the app framework using only HTML and SASS as part of my early learning process. Following my learning JavaScript, I implemented it using Webpack.

&nbsp;The motivation behind building this NGO app stems from the multitude of global issues such as climate change, wars, diseases, poverty, and more. It is my hope that people recognize the role of NGOs more prominently and take collective action for a better world.

&nbsp;World Heart is a nonprofit organization committed to connecting donors with grassroots projects worldwide. This SPA application provides insights into the organization's mission, ongoing projects, and provides avenues for users to contribute.
